# Auth101 Project

Welcome to the Auth101 project! 

The source code in this repo is mainly for my [Auth101 Blog](https://geekcoding101.com/) series on my personal blog website, covering different aspects of authentication in the information security domain. 

It serves as a learning platform to explore various authentication methods in information technology security. 

The project aims to provide hands-on examples and best practices for implementing authentication mechanisms.
