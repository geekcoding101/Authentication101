# Auth101 Project

Welcome to the Auth101 project! 

The source code in this repo is mainly for my [Auth101 Blog](https://medium.com/authentication101-blog) series on Medium and my personal blog website, covering different aspects of authentication in the information security domain. 

It serves as a learning platform to explore various authentication methods in information technology security. 

The project aims to provide hands-on examples and best practices for implementing authentication mechanisms.

The blogs will gradually progress from basic concepts to more advanced topics. You can find the series under the Medium publication [Auth101 Blog](https://medium.com/authentication101-blog).
